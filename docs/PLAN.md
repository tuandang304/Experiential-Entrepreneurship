# PLAN.md — Implementation Checklist (AIMA)

> **This file is the single source of truth for implementation progress.**
>
> **Rules:**
> 1. Whenever any function below is completed (implemented **and** verified), update this file **in the same commit/PR**: change `[ ]` to `[x]` and append the completion date, e.g. `[x] FR-01 Register — done 2026-06-12`.
> 2. Items do **not** need to be done in order — pick any item, in any group.
> 3. If the scope changes (item added/removed/redefined), update this checklist and the related doc (REQUIREMENTS.md, etc.) together.
