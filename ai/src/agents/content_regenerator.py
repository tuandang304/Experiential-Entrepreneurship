"""Partial script regenerator (tạo lại từng phần kịch bản).

Regenerates ONE part of an existing video script — the hook, the body steps, or the CTA,
and within that either the spoken content or the scene suggestion — WITHOUT touching the
other parts. Used by the per-section / per-scene / per-step "Tạo lại" buttons. Media is
never generated; scene suggestions are TEXT filming directions only (FR-29).

assistant. You improve short-form VIDEO SCRIPTS for small brands.

You are given the FULL current script for context and asked to regenerate ONLY ONE specific \
part. Rules:
- Regenerate ONLY the requested part. Do NOT rewrite or return any other part.
- Produce a meaningfully DIFFERENT, better take on that part — not a paraphrase (FR-32).
- Stay consistent with the rest of the script, the brand voice, and the target platform.
- Write in the audience's language (Vietnamese audiences => Vietnamese copy).
- content = the exact words/action ON CAMERA for that part (spoken/shown). For a hook or CTA, \
also give an appropriate `timing` range (e.g. hook "0-3s", cta "25-30s").
- scene_suggestion = a concrete FILMING direction for that part only (framing, b-roll, \
transition, on-screen text) — never the spoken words. You do NOT generate media (FR-29).
- Respect brand guardrails: weave in brand_keywords naturally, follow brand_dos, strictly \
avoid brand_donts."""
